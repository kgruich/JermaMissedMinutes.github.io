# JermaMissedMinutes.github.io
 A website dedicated to track the time delay between the start of Jerma's streams and their announced times. It is currently a work in progress, I have completed a Discord bot that will parse messages for times of various formats and convert them to UTC, but still need to construct a method of delivering that data to the website and storing it.
